# Private key can be provided as a file path:
# GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/your-app.private-key.pem
# Or as base64-encoded content (useful for CI/CD environments):
# To encode: base64 -i your-key.pem (macOS) or base64 -w 0 your-key.pem (Linux)
# GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64=LS0tLS1CRUdJTi4uLg==
#
# Note: If both GITHUB_TOKEN and GitHub App credentials are set, GITHUB_TOKEN takes precedence.
